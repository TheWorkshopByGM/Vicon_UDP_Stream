# Vicon Vision System UDP Stream Reader
This repository contains two Python scripts that read the UDP stream sent by a Vicon Vision System and extract information from it. The two scripts are:

python_udp_read_raw_data.py: This script prints all the raw data sent on the UDP stream.

python_udp_read_position_data.py: This script only prints position and attitude data.


Before running any of the scripts, please ensure that you are connected to the same network/WiFi as the Vicon Vision System.
